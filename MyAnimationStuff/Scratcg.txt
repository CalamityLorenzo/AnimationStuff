Map class
=========
Large array of blocks that has the background.
So:
1. Decide on a block size
2. Create a large array that describes that area.
There are two aspects here.
a. Graphics
b. Collision Map.


If there is a portion of the map off the screen, we don't draw it.
Only draw elements of the array that are currently visible.
thus -
1. Don't draw negative value map elements
2. Don't draw Elements that are positioned greated than the screenWidth. (Their start position, not length)
3. Don't draw Elements that are positioned greater than the screen Heighr (Their, start position, not height)

We need track the positions of the elements releative to the screen....
